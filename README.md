# Simple Flask Sign-Up Page

This project contains a minimal Flask web application that provides a basic sign-up page for users.

Features
Users can sign up by entering a username, email, and password.
User data is stored in memory (for demonstration purposes only).
Passwords are securely hashed using Werkzeug.
Duplicate usernames are prevented.
Success and error messages are displayed to users.

How to Run

Make sure you have Python and Flask installed.
Run the application:
python main.py
Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/register](http://127.0.0.1:5000/register)
Note
This is a simple demo and does not use a database. For real applications, use a proper database and add more security features.
