# Simple Flask Sign-Up Page

This project contains a minimal Flask web application that provides a basic sign-up page for users.

## Features
- Users can sign up by entering a username, email, and password.
- User data is stored in memory (for demonstration purposes only).
- Passwords are securely hashed using Werkzeug.
- Duplicate usernames are prevented.
- Success and error messages are displayed to users.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python and Flask installed.
2. Run the application:
	```
	python main.py
	```
3. Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/PROTOCOL404](http://127.0.0.1:5000/PROTOCOL404)

## Note
This is a simple demo and does not use a database. For real applications, use a proper database and add more security features.
